BowlingKata
===========

#### Kata:
A game of bowling lasts ten frames. In each frame, the bowler makes one or two attempts to knock down ten pins. If they get a strike, they score ten pins plus the number of pins knocked down on their next two rolls. If they get a spare, they scores ten pins plus the number of pins knocked down on their next roll. If the bowler fails to knock down all ten pins they score the number of pins knocked down. The scores accumulate through all ten frames. At the last frame, if necessary, the pins are reset for one or two additional rolls to count the final bonus.

C# implementation of the Bowling Game Kata.
